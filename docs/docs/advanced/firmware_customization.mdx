title: Customizing the firmware
description: How to adopt and customize the firmware for your own needs.

Since the Home Assistant Glow's firmware is based on [ESPHome](https://esphome.io), making
customizations to the firmware is as easy as editing some YAML. The best way to modify the
firmware config is by installing the [ESPHome Dashboard](https://esphome.io/guides/getting_started_hassio.html).

## Adopting the Device

Once ESPHome Dashboard is running, and your Home Assistant Glow is connected to your network,
it should prompt you to adopt it.

</p>

Go through the adoption flow; it will do these things:

1. Create an ESPHome configuration file
2. Set an API encryption key (used by Home Assistant or other native API consumers)
3. Bake the Wi-Fi credentials into the firmware
4. Install the new firmware to the device

## Understanding the Configuration

### Components

To keep things maintainable and to make it easier to build firmware for different board types,
each large part of the configuration is broken up into its own "components". There are currently
three components, all of which are included in the base config:

- `basis.yaml`: package related to the basic functionality of the device
- `pulse_meter.yaml`: package related to the pulse meter
- `status_led.yaml`: package related to the status LED
- `updates.yaml`: package related to the OTA updates

All of these components can be found on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/klaasnicolaas/home-assistant-glow/tree/main/components).

## Make customizations

After adopting the device, you can make customizations to the firmware by editing the YAML
files. You can do this by clicking the **EDIT** button in the ESPHome dashboard. This will open
the YAML editor, where you can make changes to the configuration.

</p>

When you open the YAML editor you will see a minimal configuration of your Home Assistant Glow,
if you want to make adjustments to, e.g., the [pulse_meter] component then the best way
is to use an [!extend].

```yaml title="your_glow_config.yaml"
sensor:
  - id: !extend sensor_energy_pulse_meter
    internal_filter: 100ms
```

With the above example, you will add an [internal_filter], which can be useful if high power values are measured.
